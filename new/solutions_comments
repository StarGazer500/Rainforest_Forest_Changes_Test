test1 used dask and numba with no cython module

test2 used many cython function delarations with dask arrays and no numba module

test3 used multiprocessing with virtual memory pools. dask and numba used

In overral conclution, test 4 is the fasttest followed test 2. multiprocessing seems to be the lowest
